Hello, thank you for downloading my asset pack!

The current version of this project includes 27 parts, plus the Aseprite source file.

These are: 2 tracks, 5 bodies + 1 minor variant, 7 heads + 1 minor variant, 4 side attachments + 1 minor variant, and 6 back attachments.

All files are aligned into a 64x64 px grid.

If this pack does well, I can update it with more variants that people request, or animated parts. Feel free to send me a message or comment on its page with specific requests.

It was written for a specific website, but the principle of implying value from a scarcity that is not present on this asset pack remains the same across the Internet:
